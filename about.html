            <p><strong>And I've been making stuff ever since.</strong></p>
            <p>I've always been a tinker. From my time as a child, dissecting every toy in my possession, to becoming a teenager and turning a wrench on each bolt on my car, to owning a house and working my way through a seemingly endless barrage of home improvement projects, Iâ€™ve always been one to explore my creative and mechanical sides and have never been afraid to get my hands dirty.</p>
